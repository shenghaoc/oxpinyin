# Upstream divergences

Purpose: a register of behaviours that oxpinyin cannot or deliberately does
not reproduce because of a Rust language mechanism. Source policy permits
reading and copying upstream; this file is for the residue. Once the rewrite
is complete, these notes are collected to report back to libpinyin.

## Entry template

```markdown
### <short name>

- **Upstream source cite:** `path:lines` in the pinned libpinyin source.
- **Mechanism:** what the C++ does.
- **What oxpinyin does instead:** the Rust behaviour.
- **Externally observable:** yes/no and how a caller would see it.
```

## Register

### Bigram export iterator's pinyin buffer

- **Upstream source cite:** `src/pinyin.cpp:842-872`
  (`pinyin_bigram_iterator_has_next_phrase` builds the `m_pinyins` join
  buffer).
- **Mechanism:** the export iterator keeps C pointers into reused
  pronunciation/join buffers. Repeating an export cycle inside one context
  reuses stale storage and the pinned oracle segfaults.
- **What oxpinyin does instead:** `CapiContext::export_bigram_rows` renders
  the complete row snapshot up front into owned Rust strings before the
  iterator handle is created, so repeated iterator cycles cannot alias stale
  C storage. The per-round train differential runs one export per fresh
  context for the oracle and compares those rows to oxpinyin
  (`tools/bisection/run-train-diff.sh`).
- **Externally observable:** yes — upstream aborts on the repeated-export
  sequence; oxpinyin returns the same rows on every cycle. Also cross-indexed
  in `reference/memory-safety-bugs.md` (use-after-free class).

### Public bigram export is a rendering surface

- **Upstream source cite:** `src/pinyin.cpp:775-918`.
- **Mechanism:** the public bigram iterators render the store: sentence-start
  predecessors are dropped, counts are doubled, below-threshold rows are
  hidden, pronunciations are expanded as a Cartesian product, and
  per-predecessor totals are unreachable.
- **What oxpinyin does instead:** the C ABI reproduces that rendering for
  compatibility; the one-time migration tool does not use the lossy iterator
  and instead links the pinned `libstorage.a` through a dump shim to read the
  raw user-store values (`docs/findings/legacy-migration.md` §3).
- **Externally observable:** yes — the C ABI surface matches; the migration
  tool is an internal tool and keeps the full value surface.

### HANYU full pinyin ignores tone digits under USE_TONE

- **Upstream source cite:** `FullPinyinParser2::parse_one_key`
  (`src/storage/pinyin_parser2.cpp:155-205`): under `USE_TONE` a
  trailing digit 1–5 is the tone and is consumed with the match
  (`zai4` consumes 4; aux renders `zai4`).
- **What oxpinyin does instead:** the HANYU full-pinyin surface
  (`pinyin_parse_more_full_pinyins` → `Session::type_pinyin`) treats
  the digit as junk — `zai4` consumes 3. The frozen full-pinyin corpus
  is tone-less, so every earlier differential ran a profile without
  `USE_TONE` and the gap was unmeasured until the W15 full-scheme
  driver swept scheme 1 with tones.
- **Scope:** HANYU only. LUOMA and SECONDARY_ZHUYIN carry the pinned
  tone-digit behavior (`full_pinyin_index.rs`), and the bopomofo
  keyboards always did.
- **Externally observable:** yes, only with `USE_TONE` set on the
  context — the fork never sets it for full pinyin (ibus-libpinyin
  1.16.5 calls no tone-bearing full-pinyin path), so the borrowed
  frontend cannot reach the divergence.
- **Status:** recorded, not chased — closing it means teaching the
  frozen HANYU parser (or its capi seam) the tone-digit rule, which is
  HANYU-surface work outside the #109 scheme stack.

### Scheme setters abort or half-mutate on the no-op slots

The #109 contract-lock (all rows verified at `0c5e80e1`; oxpinyin
answers `false` and keeps the previous scheme in every case, pinned by
`contract_tests.rs`):

- **double CUSTOMIZED (30)** — upstream aborts mid-call inside
  `DoublePinyinParser2::set_scheme` (`pinyin_parser2.cpp:611-612`)
  after the unconditional fallback clear already ran. The API wrapper
  `pinyin_set_double_pinyin_scheme` (`pinyin.cpp:1154-1159`) never
  returns.
- **double out-of-enum (0, 7–29, 31+)** — the parser clears
  `m_fallback_table` first (`pinyin_parser2.cpp:582`), returns `false`;
  the wrapper ignores the result and answers **`true`**. A live
  fallback-bearing scheme (ZRM/PYJJ/XHE) silently loses its fallback
  while the caller is told the call succeeded: a half-mutation.
  oxpinyin rejects with `false` and the fallback keeps working.
- **zhuyin STANDARD_DVORAK (7)** — the API routes 7 into
  `ZhuyinSimpleParser2::set_scheme`, whose dvorak arm assigns both
  tables and falls through into `default: abort()`
  (`zhuyin_parser2.cpp:291-295`). **Still present at libpinyin tip
  `95e3af7`** (report-back candidate; the keyboard is dormant until
  upstream fixes the fallthrough — then it becomes a table-addition
  port, not a contract slot). The API wrapper also `delete`s the old
  parser before the switch (`pinyin.cpp:1163-1164`), so the context
  would be broken even if the abort were caught.
- **zhuyin out-of-enum** — aborts at the API layer's `default:`
  (`pinyin.cpp:1188`); **full-pinyin out-of-enum** aborts inside
  `FullPinyinParser2::set_scheme` (`pinyin_parser2.cpp:398`) while the
  wrapper (`pinyin.cpp:1148-1153`) answers `true` unconditionally.

**Externally observable:** only through crash or lied-about state —
oxpinyin's `false` + unchanged is the non-aborting contract the
constitution requires; no oracle differential is possible for these
inputs (the pin-built `.so` SIGABRTs).
